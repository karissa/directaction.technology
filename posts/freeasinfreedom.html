<h1>Free as in freedom</h1>
<p>by Karissa McKelvey</p>

<p>We can think of direct action as a frame of knowing -- a way of translating internal desires directly into the external world. Defined in Meriam-Webster as "the use of strikes, demonstrations, or other public forms of protest rather than negotiation to achieve one's demands," direct action is often employed in the fight against unjust government or corporate initiatives, for a better world. Similarly, technology has been hailed as a means to create a better world by techno-optimists. Last week at #jquerySF, a conference for frontend developers, the MC cried "We are changing the world!" -- not unlike one might truly believe at a protest or demonstration employing direct action.</p>

<p>In both situations, people believe in a new world and want to see it come into fruition -- they want that new world in spite of negotiations or processes put in place by structures around them. "Hackers," a term usually reserved by traditional media for criminals or cyberspace terrorists, has been reclaimed by young techno-optimists as a comfortable and relatable identity. The battleground in question for this group, instead of physical space as it is for traditional direct action and civil disobedience, is cyberspace.</p>

<p>Hackerspaces, in particular, exist in a realm where problems are solved in a landscape of "do-ocracy" or "doOcracy," defined as an organization in which "responsibilities attach to people who do the work, rather than elected or selected officials" from <a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/DoOcracy">CommunityWiki</a>. Sudorooom, a popular non-heirarchical, open hackerspace in Oakland, CA is built upon this principle. One of Sudoroom's core values is "value do-ocracy over bureaucracy," posing a clear dichotomy  between elaborate structures and looser requirements to complete group tasks.</p>

<p>As a thought experiment: Uber, for example, could be -- and often is -- described as an organization employing radical direct action for the betterment of humanity. Their un-licensed taxi business is arguably illegal in many cities, and they've been sued for it. Moreover, many have criticized Uber for ignoring decades of regulations of the taxi industry that were created for <em>reasons</em>. They forge ahead anyway, exploiting the loophole boldly, with legal fees cited as a necessary cost to changing the world. It is clear, though, that all their efforts point to the continuing goal of increasing profit at the expense of the regulated industry -- which in the end, is not much of a change at all. Herein lies an extreme, albeit telling example of why "for whom" is a question that needs to be answered, and how the language of "changing the world" is easy to adopt for technology projects, even when that may not be the case.</p>

<p>When speaking about technology, the line is made blurry between "fighting injustice through breaking the law" and "gaining profits while escaping regulatory structures." But this is not a new problem. The old adage of "free as in speech, not <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/">free as in beer"</a>, is used as a measuring stick for deciding what projects lie on the right side of this line. "Free as in beer" refers to software projects that are free, like a gift; however, users do not have a voice in the governing body and cannot verify or remix the code -- too often, users are surveilled, packaged, and resold on the market. "Free as in speech" refers to software that is open source, employing governance structures in which  users can enter. <p>

<h3>Do-ocracy</h3>

<p>But it goes even deeper -- the history of computer technology, funded by military interests with prominent figures like Grace Hopper at the literal helm, were to create in lieu of negotiation.</p>
